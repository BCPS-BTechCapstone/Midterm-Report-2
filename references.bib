  abstract = {Introduction Chest X-rays (CXR) with under-exposure increase image noise and this may affect convolutional neural network (CNN) performance. This study aimed to train and validate CNNs for classifying pneumonia on CXR as normal or pneumonia acquired at different image noise levels. Methods The study used the curated and publicly available ``Chest X-Ray Pneumonia'' dataset of 5856 AP CXR classified into 1583 normal, 4273 viral and bacterial pneumonia cases. Gaussian noise with zero mean was added to the images, at 5 image noise variance levels, corresponding to decreasing exposure. Each noise-level dataset was split into 80\% for training, 10\% for validation, and 10\% for test data and then classified using custom trained sequential CNN architecture. Six classification tasks were developed for five Gaussian noise levels and the original dataset. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and accuracy were used as evaluation performance metrics. Results CNN evaluation on the different datasets revealed no performance drop from the original dataset to the five datasets with different noise levels. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for the normal datasets were 98.7\%, 76.1\% and 90.2\%. For the five Gaussian noise levels the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy ranged from 96.9\% to 98.2\%, 94.4\%--98.7\% and 96.8\%--97.6\%, respectively. A heat map was used for visual explanation of the CNNs. Conclusion The CNNs sensitivity maintained, and the specificity increased in distinguishing between normal and pneumonia CXR with the introduction of image noise. Implications for practice No performance drops of CNNs in distinguishing cases with and without pneumonia CXR with different Gaussian noise levels was observed. This has potential for decreasing radiation dose to patients or maintaining exposure parameters for patients that require additional radiographs.},

However, the ML model is highly dependent on data. This paper draws on the experience of the image data augmentation approaches, and proposes a simple material data augmentation method, which aims to solve the difficulties of small samples and large noise of material data, by adding Gaussian noise to the original data to generate more ``pseudo samples''. This work respectively starts by the HEA phase classification task and the hardness regression task, to study the effect of noise on data enhancement. It is found that the noise samples are different samples with new information. The noise samples enhanced data can significantly improve the test results of the models. Further testing results with the validation set that the models have never seen before, demonstrate that the regression model of medium noise samples enhanced has the best prediction accuracy (R2~=~0.954). It turns out that the data enhancement method applied in this work helps the ML models to achieve a more efficient and accurate prediction of HEA phase and hardness. Besides, this work provides a reference method for improving the ML models and designing new HEA.},

Secondly, the public NIR spectroscopy datasets are briefly discussed, with links provided. Thirdly, the widely used data preprocessing and feature selection algorithms that have been reported for NIR spectroscopy are presented. Then, the majority of the traditional machine learning methods and deep network architectures that are commonly employed are covered. Finally, we conclude that developing the integration of a variety of machine learning algorithms in an efficient and lightweight manner is a significant future research direction.},
